    "q1": {
      "question": "How long does blood donation take?",
      "answer": "The entire process takes about 45 minutes to an hour, including registration, health screening, and the actual donation. The blood collection itself only takes 10-15 minutes."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is blood donation safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, blood donation is completely safe. All needles and equipment are sterile, single-use, and disposed of after each donation. You cannot contract any disease by donating blood."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Will I feel weak after donating blood?",
      "answer": "Most people feel fine after donating blood. Your body replaces the donated plasma within 24 hours and red blood cells within 4-6 weeks. We recommend resting for 10-15 minutes and drinking plenty of fluids."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How often can I donate blood?",
      "answer": "You can donate whole blood every 3 months (12 weeks). For platelet donation, you can donate every 2 weeks. It's important to allow your body adequate time to replenish."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "What should I do before donating blood?",
      "answer": "Eat a healthy meal, drink plenty of water, get adequate sleep, and bring a valid ID. Avoid fatty foods before donation and inform staff of any medications you're taking."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "Can I donate if I have a tattoo?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can donate blood if you got a tattoo more than 3 months ago from a licensed facility. This waiting period helps ensure safety."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "What happens to my donated blood?",
      "answer": "Your donated blood is tested, processed, and separated into components (red cells, platelets, plasma). These components are then stored and distributed to hospitals where they save lives."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "Can I donate if I'm taking medication?",
      "answer": "It depends on the medication. Most common medications don't prevent donation, but some may require a waiting period. Please consult with our medical staff during screening."
